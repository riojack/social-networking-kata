Social networks.  Get you one!

This kata replicates how the delivery discipline within Pillar represents business value.  At Pillar, we begin solution and product development with value stories.  Here's what we define as a value story:

> A Value Story is a statement of a particular chunk of business value expected to be realized by this project.  A Value Story is a one sentence expression of how value is achieved by a business case objective.  One project can have multiple value stories but one value story should not be spread across multiple projects.  Value stories may originate in a business case or return-on-investment document produced to justify this project.

From value stories we create user stories.  Here's what we define as a user story:

> A user story is a fine grained artifact that defines work within an agile cadence.  User stories should be the smallest piece of work that the business is willing to sign off on.

User stories relate directly back to a value story, and several user stories may be needed to satisfy a value story.

### Social Networking Value Stories

For this kata, we will focus on two value stories.

> As a social network user
> I want to be able to read my friends posts 
> So that I can stay updated on their happenings.

And...

> As a social network user
> I want to be able to post a message
> So that my friends can stay updated on my happenings.

### The User Stories

> Given I am in the application
> When I want to subscribe to "Bob"
> And I type "Bob wall"
> Then I should become subscribed to his post feed.

> Given I am in the application
> And I am subscribed to "Bob"
> When I enter "Bob"
> Then I should see his or her post feed
